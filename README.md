Run the game by executing `RDG++.exe` in the folder `Executable\RDG++`

In this game, you fight different opponents in a pokemon-like fashion.
You can choose 4 areas of attack (legs/arms/torso/head), parry an enemy attack, use potions and change your equipment. Each defeated enemy increases one of your skills: accuracy, speed, strength.

The game is set in a maze, and you can find items that make you stronger (equipment and potions).
Your main opponent is waiting for you in the center of the maze, but in order to gain entrance to the central chamber, you need to find a key hidden somewhere in the maze.

Also, it would be wise to fight as many opponents as possible before challenging the final opponent in order to level up your character or you won't stand a chance in the final fight.
